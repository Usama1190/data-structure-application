* `else`
* Comparison and logical operators

## ðŸ§ª Code Explanation

### âžž Step 1: main Method

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 18;
    
    if (age < 13) {
        System.out.println("You are a child.");
    } else if (age < 20) {
        System.out.println("You are a teenager.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("You are an adult.");
    }
}
```

### âžž Step 2: `if-else` Logic

* `if (age < 13)` â†’ checks if the age is less than 13
* `else if (age < 20)` â†’ runs if the age is between 13 and 19
* `else` â†’ runs when none of the above conditions are true

## âœ… Output

```
You are a teenager.
```

## ðŸ“˜ Notes

* Use `==` to compare equality (e.g., `if (a == b)`)
* Use `!=` for not equal
* Use `&&` (AND), `||` (OR) for combining conditions
* Always use curly braces `{}` to avoid mistakes and improve readability

## ðŸ”„ Real-World Example

Conditional statements are used everywhere â€” for example:

* Showing age-specific content on a website
* Controlling access to features based on user role or status
