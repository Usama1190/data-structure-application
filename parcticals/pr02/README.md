# Practical 02: Arrays in Java

This practical demonstrates how to declare, initialize, and use arrays in Java, based on **Topic 02: Arrays**.

---

## ðŸ”¸ Objective

- Understand what an array is.
- Learn how to declare, create, and initialize arrays in Java.
- Access array elements.
- Loop through arrays using `for` and `for-each` loops.

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- Fixed-size containers to hold elements of the same type.
- Index-based access.
- Looping through array elements.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `main.java` â†’ contains Java code for practicing arrays.

## ðŸ§ª Steps Explained

### âœ… Step 1: Declare and Initialize an Array

```java
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
This creates an array named numbers that stores 5 integers.

âœ… Step 2: Access Elements by Index
java
Copy
Edit
System.out.println(numbers[0]);  // Output: 10
System.out.println(numbers[1]);  // Output: 20
Arrays in Java are zero-indexed, so numbers[0] gives the first item.

âœ… Step 3: Loop Through Array Using for
java
Copy
Edit
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
This prints all elements from the numbers array using traditional indexing.

âœ… Step 4: Loop Using for-each
java
Copy
Edit
for (int num : numbers) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
A shorter and cleaner way to iterate over all items in the array.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Arrays are fixed in size.

All elements must be of the same data type.

We'll later learn more flexible structures like ArrayList.

âœ… Output (Example)

10
20
30
40
50
